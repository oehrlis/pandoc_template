# Introduction
<!-- markdownlint-configure-file { "MD013": { "tables": false } } -->
Add a short introduction to the *Good Practice* guide.

## Overview

Creating documentation is one of the regular activities of a consultant.
Whether it is the creation of simple notes to log the work at the customer site
or the creation of extensive documentation such as concepts, infrastructure
assessments, security reviews or installation and operation manuals. The focus
of these documents is primarily on the content. Nevertheless, these documents
represent Trivadis and its products, services and employees to the outside world.

For these reasons, it is important that technical documents also fit in with
Trivadis' corporate identity. The use of different templates, some of which are
old or incomplete, makes it impossible to achieve this goal. Also the use of
different tools for documentation does not make it easier at all. The use of
Markdown as the basis for the documentation allows the focus on the content as
well as the easy use of a version control like GIT. The documents can then be
converted to a number of different formats using Pandoc, including DOCX, PDF,
ePUB, HTML and more.

## Goals

This documentation serves as a Markdown template. In addition to the document
structure, various formatting examples are shown. Furthermore, this document is
used for the verification of the Trivadis templates with *Pandoc*.

## Scope

This documentation describes the *Trivadis Markdown Doc Template* and the process
for automated generation of Trivadis documents. This includes examples of
formatting, explanation of templates, and easy use of *Pandoc*.

In particular, the following objectives are to be achieved:

- Demonstrate how to create technical documentation using Markdown
- Author's guide for technical documentation
- Document structure and formatting examples
- Example document for the verification of the different Trivadis templates in
  connection with *Pandoc*.
