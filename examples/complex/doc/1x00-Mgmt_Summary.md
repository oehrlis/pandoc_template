# Management Summary

Various types of technical documentation are created at Trivadis. This includes
documentation of technical assesments, concepts, installation and operation
manuals and many more. These documents often include a lot of code blocks,
graphics, tables etc. Adhering to the corporate identity and implementing unified
formatting is usually time-consuming and cumbersome. Depending on the project,
there are also different requirements for what target formats are to be created
i.e. Word documents, PDF etc.

This documentation or Markdown template serves as a basis for Markdown-based
documentation. With the help of corresponding reference documents, *TeX*
templates and *pandoc*, the various target documents can be created automatically.
The source remains text files with Markdown, which can be versioned relatively
easily with GIT.

It contains:

- Meta information about the document
- Document structure
- Various format examples
- Examples for appendices
